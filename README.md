# Churning_customer


The code is a machine learning project that predicts customer churn. It starts by loading and exploring a dataset, performs data preprocessing, and analyzes feature importance using a Random Forest Classifier. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted through boxplots, and machine learning models (Random Forest and Neural Network) are trained and evaluated. The best model is saved, and the code concludes with instructions with a streamlit web that allows users to input new customer data for churn prediction, including a confidence factor. The deployed model enables real-time predictions in the chosen application platform.
